## 🚧 Outstanding Work

### HIGH PRIORITY (Core Functionality)

#### 1. Sequences UI (Frontend Components)
**Status**: Not started  
**Complexity**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**What's Needed**:
- [ ] **SequencesList**: List/grid view of sequence templates
  - Cards showing step count, channels used
  - Active/inactive indicator
  - Quick actions (edit, delete, duplicate)
  - Search and filter
  
- [ ] **SequenceBuilder**: Form for creating/editing sequences
  - Sequence metadata (name, description)
  - Step builder interface:
    - Add/remove steps
    - Drag-and-drop reordering
    - For each step:
      - Step number (auto-calculated)
      - Channel selector
      - Day delay input
      - Option: Use MessageTemplate OR write inline
      - Subject input (email only)
      - Message body textarea with variables
      - Preview pane with variable substitution
  - Save as draft or activate
  
- [ ] **SequencesPage**: Main page at `/sequences`
  - Layout with header and action buttons
  - Integration with SequencesList
  - "New Sequence" button opens SequenceBuilder
  - Navigation integration

**API Coverage**: ✅ Complete (all CRUD endpoints ready)

#### 2. Apply Sequences to People
**Status**: Not started  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**What's Needed**:
- [ ] **Person Detail Page Updates**:
  - "Start Sequence" button/section
  - Sequence template selector (dropdown or modal)
  - Confirmation dialog with preview
  - Active sequences list for this person:
    - Template name
    - Status (Active/Paused/Completed)
    - Current step (e.g., "Step 2 of 4")
    - Next scheduled time
    - Actions: Pause/Resume, Cancel, Skip Step
  
- [ ] **API Integration**:
  - Create endpoint: `POST /api/persons/[id]/sequences`
    - Accepts: templateId
    - Creates: OutreachSequence instance
    - Copies: SequenceTemplateSteps → SequenceSteps
    - Calculates: Execution times
  - List endpoint: `GET /api/persons/[id]/sequences`
  - Control endpoints: `PATCH /api/sequences/[id]/pause|resume|cancel`

**Technical Notes**:
- When applying template, copy all steps with calculated execution times
- startedAt = now
- nextStepAt = startedAt + first step's delayDays
- Each step gets absolute execution time (not relative)

#### 3. Cron Execution Logic
**Status**: Partial (cron route exists but doesn't execute sequences)  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**What's Needed**:
- [ ] Update `/api/cron/outreach`:
  - Query OutreachSequences where:
    - status = ACTIVE
    - nextStepAt <= NOW()
  - For each sequence:
    - Get current SequenceStep
    - Create Inngest event with:
      - personId
      - stepId
      - channel
      - message content (with variables)
    - On success:
      - Mark step.executed = true
      - Set step.executedAt
      - Calculate next step time
      - Update sequence.nextStepAt
      - Increment sequence.currentStep
    - On last step completion:
      - Set sequence.status = COMPLETED
      - Set sequence.completedAt
  
- [ ] Update Inngest `sendOutreachMessage`:
  - Accept sequence context
  - Variable substitution from Person data
  - Create Message record
  - Handle delivery errors
  - Retry logic

**Technical Notes**:
- Idempotency: Don't re-send already executed steps
- Concurrency: Handle multiple sequences at once
- Timezone: Document timezone assumptions (UTC?)
- Error handling: What happens if Twilio/Resend fails?

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhanced Features)

#### 4. Provider Delivery Webhooks
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

**What's Needed**:
- [ ] **Twilio Webhook**: `/api/webhooks/twilio`
  - Parse Twilio status callbacks
  - Map to Message.status:
    - delivered → DELIVERED
    - failed → FAILED
    - undelivered → FAILED
  - Update Message.deliveredAt or Message.failedAt
  - Store error details in Message.errorMessage
  
- [ ] **Resend Webhook**: `/api/webhooks/resend`
  - Parse Resend events:
    - email.delivered → DELIVERED
    - email.bounced → BOUNCED
    - email.opened → track separately?
    - email.clicked → track separately?
  - Update Message accordingly
  
- [ ] **Configuration**:
  - Document webhook URLs in README
  - Add signature verification
  - Test with provider test events

**Benefits**:
- Real-time delivery tracking
- Better audit trail
- Can auto-pause sequences on delivery failures

#### 5. Real Analytics Dashboard
**Status**: Mock data exists  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**What's Needed**:
- [ ] Replace mock chart data in dashboard
- [ ] Aggregate Messages by:
  - Channel (Email/WhatsApp/SMS)
  - Status (Sent/Delivered/Failed)
  - Date (daily/weekly/monthly)
- [ ] KPIs:
  - Total messages sent
  - Delivery rate (delivered / sent)
  - Failure rate (failed / sent)
  - Email-specific: Open rate, Click rate
- [ ] Sequence-specific analytics:
  - Active sequences count
  - Completion rate
  - Average time to complete
  - Most used templates

**Technical Notes**:
- Use Prisma aggregations
- Consider caching for performance
- Date range filters

#### 6. LinkedIn Integration
**Status**: Planned for future  
**Complexity**: High (depends on approach)  
**Estimated Effort**: Variable

**Client Request**: Include LinkedIn messaging in sequences

**Options**:
1. **LinkedIn Recruiter API** (Official)
   - Requires: LinkedIn Recruiter license (expensive)
   - Pros: Official, reliable
   - Cons: Cost, limited availability
   
2. **LinkedIn Sales Navigator API**
   - Similar to above
   
3. **Third-Party Services**
   - Phantombuster: LinkedIn automation tool
   - Dux-Soup: Chrome extension-based
   - Pros: Easier setup, lower cost
   - Cons: Against LinkedIn ToS, risk of account suspension
   
4. **Manual Tracking**
   - Mark steps as "needs LinkedIn message"
   - User manually sends via LinkedIn
   - Mark as completed in system
   - Pros: Safe, compliant
   - Cons: Not fully automated

**Current Status**:
- Commented in MessageChannel enum: `// LINKEDIN`
- TODO note added
- Ready to uncomment when integration chosen

**Recommended Approach for POC**: Manual tracking (#4)
